/**
 * Global Descriptor Table
 * =======================
 *
 * The Global Descriptor Table (GDT) is a data structure used by Intel x86
 * processors starting with 80286 to define characteristics of the various
 * memory areas used during program execution. These memory areas are called
 * segments in Intel terminology.
 * GDT can hold things other than segment descriptors as well. Every 8-byte
 * entry in the GDT is a descriptor, these can be Task State Segment (TSS)
 * descriptors, Local Descriptor table (LDT) descriptors, or Call Gate desc.
 *
 * On most modern Operating Systems segments are initialized to cover the
 * entire addressable memory, which make segment-relative addressing
 * transparent to the user.
 * Also note that to implement memory protection, segmentation has been 
 * replaced by paging.
 *
 * To reference a segment, a program must use its index inside the GDT.
 * Such an index is called a *segment selector*. The selector must be loaded
 * into a *segment register* to be used.
 * Every machine instruction referencing memory has an implicit segment 
 * register. The segment register can be explicitly overwritten by adding a
 * segment prefix before the instruction.
 *
 * Loading a selector into a segment register automatically reads the GDT
 * and stores properties within the processor itself. Subsequent modifications
 * of the GDT will not be effective unless the segment reg is reloaded.
 *

 * 
 * P: Present bit.
 * 	This must be 1 for all valid selectors.
 * DPL: Privilege.
 *  Contains the ring level, 0 = highest, 3 = lowest.
 * E: Executable bit.
 *  If 1 code in this segment can be executed.
 * DC: Direction/Conforming bit.
 * 	For data selectors:  tells the direction. 0 the segment grows up. 1 the
 * 	segment grows down, i.e. the offset has to be greater than the limit
 *	For code selectors: if 1 code in this segment can be executed from an
 *	equal or lower privilege level. The DPL-bits represent the highest
 *	privilege level that is allowed to execute the segment.
 *	Note that the privilege level remains the same, i.e. a far-jump form ring
 *	3 to a dpl 2 segment remains in ring 3 after the jump.
 *	If 0 code in this segment can only be executed from the ring set in dpl.
 * RW: Readable/Writable bit.
 *  Readable bit for code selectors: Whether read access for this segment is
 *  allowed. Write access is never allowed for code segments.
 *  Writable bit for data selectors: Whether write access for this segment is
 *  allowed. Read access is always allowed for data segments.
 * A: Accessed bit.
 * 	The CPU sets this to 1 when the segment is accessed.

 * +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
 *
 * Gr: Granularity bit.
 *	If 0 the limit is in 1B blocks (byte granularity).
 * 	If 1 the limit is in 4KB blocks (page granularity).
 * Sz: Size bit.
 * 	If 0 the selector defines 16 bit protected mode.
 * 	If 1 it defines 32 bit protected mode. You can have both 16 bit and 32 bit
 * 	selectors at once.
