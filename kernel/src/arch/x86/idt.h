/**
 * Interrupt Descriptor Table
 * ==========================
 *
 * The Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) is data structure used by Intel x86
 * processors to implement an interrupt vector table.
 * The IDT is used by the processor to determine the correct response to 
 * interrupts and exceptions.
 * In protected mode, the IDT is an array of 256 8-byte descriptors stored
 * consecutively in memory and indexed by an interrupt vector.
 * The descriptors contains memory addresses and a segment selector of code
 * to execute when the relative event happens. The segment selector must
 * point to a valid GDT entry.
 *

 * T: Gate Type.
 *  0x0E for 32-bit interrupt gate
 *  0x0F for 32-bit trap gate

 * The first 32 IDT elements are reserved for processor exceptions.
