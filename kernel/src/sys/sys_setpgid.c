/*
 * Sets the process group ID to pgid in the process whose process ID equals
 * pid. If the two arguments are equal, the process specified by pid becomes
 * a process group leader. If pid is 0, the process ID of the caller is used.
 * Also, if pgid is 0, the process ID specified by pid is used as the process
 * group ID.
 * A process can set the process group ID of only itself or any of its
 * children.
 *
 * Furthermore, it canâ€™t change the process group ID of one of its
 * children after that child has called one of the exec functions.
 * NOTE: for simplicity, we don't respect this last requirement here!!!
